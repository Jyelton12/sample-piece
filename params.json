It's going to sound exaggerated and fanboy-ish. But I don't care because it really was incredible. \r\n\r\nWe saw Sturgill Simpson at the Lexington Opera House and the best word I could come up with to describe the whole experience was just \"special.\" Every part of the night- Sturgill, the band, the venue, the sound, the performance- everything was, for lack of a better word, special. Significant. \r\n\r\nAfter the first couple songs, I leaned over to Kat and said \"This feels like we're watching history.\" It really felt that way. I'm serious. Like watching Elvis or Buddy Holly right before they blew up and morphed into some of the most significant, unique, and influential musical icons of all time and creators of seismic change to the path of music history. There was a moment somewhere when it happened for them, when things shifted and those artists became something much bigger than what they could have imagined when they started chasing a dream. There's always a moment like that somewhere along the line and it felt like that moment happened that night for Sturgill and the band. I have a sneaking suspicion that the number of people who claim they were there that night will grow with the benefit of time and legend. \r\n\r\nYou rolled your eyes just now but I don't blame you. If you weren't among the 1,000 fortunate individuals in attendance, those claims would sound crazy. Because they are. But that's honestly what it felt like watching the band quite-literally mesmerize a crowd of mostly Kentuckians as varied by generation as it was by walks of life. \r\n\r\nA quick note about the Lexington Opera House: the hospitality and friendliness of the group of actual ushers at the show gave everything a feeling of authenticity and importance. A very nice touch. I wish I could explain that better but I guess maybe you had to be there. \r\n\r\nThe band was flawless and incredibly tight, especially being so early in the tour. I'm at a loss for what to say about them other than that they're just damn good. I could try to describe it but there really aren't any words that would do it justice. \r\n\r\nBut I will say this: I don't care what kind of music you like or if you think you hate everything about country music today, like I once did. If you appreciate good music and a great performance and you have any chance to see him on this tour, you should definitely do it. Just trust me. \r\n\r\nI love live music more than most things in life but I've never really understood what would compel an individual to just follow around a band and see them every night in a different city the way some folks do for certain bands. It always seemed a little excessive and repetitious to me. But I get it now. I totally get it. I'm already plotting how to make it to Louisville this weekend to do the whole thing over again. \r\n\r\nOn that note, I really, really hope they are recording some of these shows and intend to put out a live album. If not, then I can't help but feel like an opportunity would be missed. I would certainly buy it. \r\n\r\nI've read some folks on social media complaining about the evolution  of Sturgill's music and \"not sticking to his roots,\" which essentially means not making every record sound like High Top Mountain. Right, because who would know better what kind of art an artist should make than the general public. That never ends well. No quicker way to kill creativity than to chase the approval of everyone. \r\n\r\nI'm not a \"music blogger.\" I'm by no means a critic of music, concerts, or anything really. I've never even thought about reviewing a restaurant on yelp after truly shitty service. I generally feel like my opinion on things is pretty insignificant. And I still do. But I felt compelled to write a \"review\" anyway, no matter how insignificant and ignored it may be. The show was easily the best live performance I've ever been lucky enough to experience. And there's no close second. \r\n\r\nIf anyone who was there that night knows of anyone doing it better right now, please let me know. Because I'd really like to see them. ",
